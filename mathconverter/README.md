# Converter for AsciiMath, LaTeX & MathML equations

Converts from AsciiMath, LaTeX, MathML to LaTeX, MathML

utilizes MathMLCloud (for MathML output) and XSL transforms (for LaTeX output).

(Optional):
```bash
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
```

Install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

```bash
./converter.py --help
```

### Example

```bash
$ ./converter.py --equation "x^2" --iformat asciimath --oformat mathml

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="x squared">
  <mstyle displaystyle="true">
    <msup>
      <mi>x</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
  </mstyle>
</math>
```

## Known issues

Don't use bash shell confusing/specific signs like e.g. `$$` or `"` in the commandline or escape them properly. If you're unsure how to do that, run the command without `--equation` like this:

```bash
$ ./converter.py --iformat asciimath --oformat mathml
```

it will prompt you for the equation that way.

### Background information

For generating MathML it is using the public reachable MathMLCloud on https://api.mathmlcloud.org/equation which is utilizing a Node.js server version of Mathjax for generating output.

LaTeX is generated by XSLTs from MathML input.

A special case is the AsciiMath to LaTeX conversion. On the first step it generates MathML from MathMLCloud and then uses the XSLTs to generate LaTeX out of it.

#### MathML to LaTeX XSLTs available in this repo:

* `xsl_yarosh` by [Vasil Yaroshevich](http://www.raleigh.ru/MathML/mmltex/). Contains XSLT 1 transformation from MathML to LaTeX
* `xsl_transpect` by [transpect.io](https://github.com/transpect/mml2tex). Contains XSLT 2 transformations from MathML to LaTeX (not used currently)
