# Maple-TAuto

Maple-TAuto is a tool made for anyone who can't be bothered to do anything <em><font face="Brush Script MT" size=4> TRIVIAL </font></em>.
It allows you to write python code (vanilla, sympy, numpy, whatever) from the browser and get the return value of your code also in the browser.

### How to use



### Vision
None, this project was made for no real reason at all (maybe to get some DTU street cred?).

### TODO
- It can't really parse vectors or matrices
- It thinks: 
<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?cos(x)=c&space;\cdot&space;o&space;\cdot&space;s&space;\cdot&space;x" title="cos(x)=c \cdot o \cdot s \cdot x" /></center>
- If one wants to be really sneaky, then:
    - Have selenium read what's in the <input> tag and then evaluate from there (i.e. discard the calculator)
    - Have it be a chrome extension rather than a selenium script
