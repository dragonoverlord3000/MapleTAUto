# Maple-TAuto

Maple-TAuto is a tool made for anyone who can't be bothered to do anything <em><font face="Brush Script MT" size=4> TRIVIAL </font></em>.
It allows you to write python code (vanilla, sympy, numpy, whatever) from the browser and get the return value of your code also in the browser.

### How to use



### Vision
None, this project was made for no real reason at all (maybe to get some DTU street cred?).

### TODO
- It can't really parse vectors or matrices
![cos(x) = c \cdot o \cdot s \cdot x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%3D%5Cfrac%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2-4ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)
- It thinks $$ cos(x) = c \cdot o \cdot s \cdot x $$
- If one wants to be really sneaky, then:
    - Have selenium read what's in the <input> tag and then evaluate from there (i.e. discard the calculator)
    - Have it be a chrome extension rather than a selenium script
